abstract: "Identifying linguistic bias in text demands the identification not only of explicitly asserted content but also of implicit content including presuppositions. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising automated approach to detecting presuppositions, yet the extent to which their judgments align with human intuitions remains unexplored. Moreover, LLMs may inadvertently reflect societal biases when identifying presupposed content. To empirically investigate this, we prompt multiple large language models to evaluate presuppositions across diverse textual domains, drawing from three distinct datasets annotated by human raters. We calculate the agreement between LLMs and human raters, and find several linguistic factors associated with fluctuations in human-model agreement. Our observations reveal discrepancies in human-model alignment, suggesting potential biases in LLMs, notably influenced by gender and political ideology."
