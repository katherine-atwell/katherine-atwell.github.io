Hello! I'm a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science at Notheastern University, and I am working with Malihe Alikhani. I am passionate about using NLP tools for good, and am currently studying bias in language through a sociolinguistic lens. I am also conducting research in the ethics space, and have an upcoming book chapter on ethics in signed languages. I have published at venues including ACL, NAACL, EACL, SIGDIAL, COLING, and COGSCI, and won a best paper award for our work at UAI 2022. Last year, I was part of a university team that placed third in the Amazon Alexa Prize Taskbot Competition!
